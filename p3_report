pca graph
what happend with pca
	- low CV accuracy
	- reasons (dimensionality reduction not suited as different reading have different meaning nd describe an essential aspect of motion, basically all are important features)
	- log likelihood vs iteration graph for gestures
	- confusion matrix for in-sample accuracy
	- full cov matrix works best, without any sort of restrictions on pi
	- a bit of description of rabiner, mit paper
	- convergence was fast in l2r nmodel but ultimately full matrix worked best
	- how to select number of observations
